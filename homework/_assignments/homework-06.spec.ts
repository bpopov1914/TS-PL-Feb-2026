// create the below 2 test scenarios and put them in a test suite
// put all groups of actions into a test.step
// use soft assertions, unless we are assrting a navigation has taken place
// try to add meaningful comments to all assertions
// you can find test execution command examples in the Readme.md file in project's main folder
// you can add -ui mode debug your tests during execution
// after execution view html report with command: 'npx playwright show-report' (if any tests failed report will open automaticaly)
// a trace artifact will be added to the report if any test has failed, you can use as well to debug your tests


// first test scenario use CSS and XPATH selectors like page.locator('location string'):

// navigate to https://rahulshettyacademy.com/AutomationPractice/
// assert succesful naviation

// check radio button #2
// assert Radio button #2 is checked

// fill the input with "Bulgaria"
// click on the first auto complete suggestion
// Verify the input value is "Bulgaria"

// select option #2 from the dropdown
// Verify the selected option is "option2"

// check checkbox #3
// Verify checkbox #3 is checked

// click on the "Hide" button
// Verify the input element is now hidden

// hover over the "Mouse Hover" element
// Verify the "Top" link is now visible


// second test scenario use only Playwright selectors like page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Вход' }).click();

// navigate to https://testautomationpractice.blogspot.com/p/playwrightpractice.html
// assert succesful naviation

// In Playwright Practice session group 1. getByRole() Locators pick a locator from section Navigation and click on it.
// assert navigation has taken place

// In Playwright Practice session group 2. getByText() Locators pick one of the paragraphs with colored text and assert its color

// In Playwright Practice session group 3. getByLabel() Locators Locators check the unchecked radio button
// assert is is checked now

// In Playwright Practice session group 4. getByPlaceholder() Locators pick an input fill and assert it is editable
// fill the input filed with text

// In Playwright Practice session group 5.getByAltText() Locators assert the image is visible

// In Playwright Practice session group 6. getByTitle() Locators assert one of the elements' full text
